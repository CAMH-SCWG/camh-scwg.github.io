{"name":"CAMH Scientific Computing Working Group","tagline":"research - computing = :-(","body":"## We are... \r\n\r\nA volunteer group of scientists, trainees (students, postdocs), administration and staff that are concerned with computing issues faced by CAMH researchers. We meet every Thursday, 3-4pm in CS 163.\r\n\r\nHere's the issue: most science done today requires computing in some form, from spreadsheets to High Performance Computing, but most scientists don't have any formal computer science training. This is a big problem, because *software is your experimental apparatus*. Just like cleaning test tubes and pipetting, computing is a basic skill you need to be competent with. \r\n\r\n### Our aims are to:\r\n\r\n1. Organize events and workshops to catalyse learning and sharing of know-how\r\n2. Advocate and advise on institutional changes to improve scientific computing\r\n3. Make the software/resources needed by CAMH researchers \r\n\r\n## Our Projects\r\n\r\n### Office Hours\r\nAnnouncing weekly research computing office hours in *CS 163, every Tuesday 11-12pm and Thursday 2-3pm*. All staff, students and trainees welcome to drop in. This is an informal space to ask your knowledgeable colleagues about any computing issue, programming/scripting question, or analysis design.\r\n\r\n### Workshops!\r\nA five-day, self-paced series of workshops on scientific computing fundamentals Nov 23-Nov 27. We are covering topics such as Linux, BASH scripting, R, Python, Matlab, Databases, using the CAMH compute cluster, spreadsheets, and databases.
