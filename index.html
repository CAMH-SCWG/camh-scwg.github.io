<a id="we-are" class="anchor" href="#we-are" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We are...</h2>

<p>A volunteer group of scientists, trainees (students, postdocs), administration and staff that are concerned with computing issues faced by CAMH researchers. We meet every Thursday, 3-4pm in CS 163.</p>

<p>Here's the issue: most science done today requires computing in some form, from spreadsheets to High Performance Computing, but most scientists don't have any formal computer science training. This is a big problem, because <em>software is your experimental apparatus</em>. Just like cleaning test tubes and pipetting, computing is a basic skill you need to be competent with. </p>

<a id="our-aims-are-to" class="anchor" href="#our-aims-are-to" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our aims are to:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Organize events and workshops to catalyse learning and sharing of know-how</li>
<li>Advocate and advise on institutional changes to improve scientific computing</li>
<li>Make the software/resources needed by CAMH researchers </li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="research-methods-talk-series" class="anchor" href="#research-methods-talk-series" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research Methods Talk Series</h3>

<p>All computationally inclined researchers, trainees and staff at CAMH are invited to attend and present a brief (20-45 minutes) talk outlining the methods used in recent work. Speakers are expected to discuss how they implemented their analysis by describing software used (snippets encouraged!), methods, data management, high performance computing and code).</p>

<h3>
<a id="office-hours" class="anchor" href="#office-hours" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Office Hours</h3>

<p>Announcing weekly research computing office hours in <em>CS 163, every Tuesday 11-12pm and Thursday 2-3pm</em>. All staff, students and trainees welcome to drop in. This is an informal space to ask your knowledgeable colleagues about any computing issue, programming/scripting question, or analysis design.</p>
